# DBIPs
.bit Improvement Proposals (DBIPs) describe standards for .bit core contracts and eco applications.

# Contributing

1. Review [DBIP-1](dbip-1.md).
2. Fork the repository.
3. Add your DBIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template DBIP here](dbip-template.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request to .bit's [DBIPs repository](https://github.com/dotbitHQ/DBIPs).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final DBIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new DBIP and assign it a number before merging it. 
Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the DBIP as a whole.

If your DBIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that DBIP as follows: `assets/dbip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the DBIP number). 
When linking to an image in the DBIP, use relative links such as `./assets/dbip-1/image.png`.
