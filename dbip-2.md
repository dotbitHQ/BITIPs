## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for DBIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the DBIP solves. DBIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The motivation is critical for DBIP. It should clearly explain why the state of the art is inadequate to address the problem that the DBIP solves. DBIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. -->
The technical specification should describe the standard in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CAIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The DBIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. DBIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
